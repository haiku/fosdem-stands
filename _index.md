  computing. Inspired by the BeOS, Haiku is fast, simple to use, easy to learn and
  yet very powerful.

  <p>Since last FOSDEM we had a Beta3 release last July which fixes 251 bugs from Beta2 and adds 1248 commits to it:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>The installation process is now much smoother.</li>
    <li>Package management received performance and stability improvement, and can now resume interrupted downloads.</li>
    <li>We switched to Python 3.7 as default.</li>
    <li>The user interface received improvements on dark color theme, scaling, and localization.</li>
    <li>The font overlay and fallback system was fixed.</li>
    <li>WebPositive automatically uses dark mode according to the current system color scheme.</li>
    <li>The WebKit version used by WebPositive was updated.</li>
    <li>A BeControlLook allows apps to match the BeOS R5 interface closely.</li>
    <li>The POSIX compatibility received many fixes and additions, including mlock/munlock, posix_fallocate and ppoll calls.</li>
    <li>Some optimizations were done in frequently used API calls.</li>
    <li>Czech translation is now available, making Haiku available in 28 languages.</li>
    <li>We improved several drivers, and added support for SD/MMC on PCI (SDHCI).</li>
  </ol>
  <p>The RISC-V port is now booting to desktop and has nightly images available.</p>
  <p>We hired one of our developers to work full time on the operating system. Consider
     <a href="https://haiku-inc.org/donate">donating (external link)</a> to support this in the
     long term.</p>
  <p>A partnership with <a href="https://freewear.org/Haiku">Freewear.org (external link)</a> allows
     us to provide new merchandise with a clear indication of hom much money gets to Haiku. This
     includes limited edition T-Shirts celebrating 20 years of existence for Haiku!</p>
showcase: |
  <p>We will be demonstrating all the neat features that makes Haiku special for us: indexed metadata in the filesystem, x-ray navigation, sliding tabs and window grouping.</p>
  <p>We also want to hear from people testing Haiku, how it worked for them, or not. We will guide you to create bug reports.</p>
  <p>We will walk
   curious people into installing Haiku in a VM or on real hardware.</p>
  <p>And we love
   stories of fond memories of BeOS and how Haiku brings those back.</p>
  <p>People
   interested into coding can also meet our developers, see where they can learn
   to program their own application, or write a recipe for HaikuPorter to port an
   existing one.</p>
  <p>And you'll see the faces of some coders you maybe already know
   from the IRC channels.</p>
